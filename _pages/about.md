I am a freelance pharmacist with ten years of experience in community pharmacies. Throughout my career, I have constantly expanded my knowledge with a drive to add value for patients and better therapeutic outcomes. 

I am fascinated about how the digital era is changing the roles of all participants â€“ patients and professionals - and the consequences of these changes for future health care. My goal in this regard is again to intervene in ways that really have an impact, hopefully making people's lives better. That's why I'm involved with Patients4Digital, a movement to make collaboration and patient empowerment a reality.

On the other hand I am very curious about learning how datafication improves patient care. It's going to have a huge effect, and so I really want to understand the topic. Because I think you don't really understand things until you get your hands dirty, I am currently learning new technologies like Python and SQL, machine learning algorithms and improving my statistics skills, which gives me a lot of joy.

I love to connect with pharmacists and other healthcare professionals, who are interested in interprofessional discourse, advocating for patient empowerment, or working in the area of Data Driven Healthcare.
